Demand and Sales Activity  
 
Compared to the previous week,  small square bal e prices were  down 8%.  Large square bale prices were 
down 6% .  Large round bale prices were down 1 %.  Sales activity was very light to  good.   
 
For Nebraska , hay prices were steady compared to two weeks ago .  Buyer inquiry has picked up the last 
couple of weeks in the Central part of the state.  Many famers have op ted not to put up cornstalk bales this 
fall and some feedlots are starting to wonder where they are going to buy a cheap roughage source. 
Steady movement on dairy hay with trucks going out every week.  Cow hay movement is slow, but some 
ranchers are starti ng to look for winter hay needs.   For Iowa , there was not a weekly report posted.  
 
In South Dakota, hay prices were steady to $0.10  lower.  Winter weather eased this week as we saw  
temperatures across the trade area move back above freezing for daytime hig hs and didn’t see any of 
those below zero temps at night.  Cows are able to graze the cornstalk fields without any supplemental 
feeding as the snow has melted and left or are starting to leave in northern parts of the state where the 
snowfalls were greater .  Demand was still very good for high testing hay or simply some lower testing 
alfalfa, but that which is clean and green, preferably out of a shed.  Lower quality hay remains abundant 
and demand is only moderate at best.  The official start of winter has n’t even begun, but the unofficial 
start happened on Nov 10.  This early start caught many off guard but now with the weather moderating 
to normal or just above normal temps there isn’t the urgency there was to get hay laid in.  Calves continue 
to be place d in feedyards keeping the demand for high quality grass hay high.   
 
For Missouri , alfalfa hay prices were steady  on very limited alfalfa hay sales.  Most cattle producers have 
begun the winter feeding season.  Hay business continues to be inactive to ver y limited.  Even with 
feeding taking place, the majority of farmers have plenty of available feed without looking off farm at this 
point.  Hay prices continue to be weak, but have dropped to the point producers likely aren't covering 
production cost as is.  As typical markets of dairy and high quality horse hay are slightly stronger due to 
the difficultly of production, but even these markets are struggling due to cheap corn prices and low milk 
prices.   
 
In  Southwest Minnesota, hay prices  were $9.15  lower o n light sales.

The demand for Illinois hay remained light to moderate, with market activity  slow to moderate, for 
moderate to heavy offerings.  Prices were $13.65 higher.  They  were steady to firm for the higher quality 
hay, with lower quality hay trendi ng steady to weak.  While many producers were getting some calls and 
interest for hay, many buyers  delayed buying for a while and not making a purchase.  Interest was lower 
this  month for dairy hay and beef, but remained good for horses.   The demand for wh eat straw remained 
good to very good, especially for small square bales,  
with trading moderate to active, for light to 
moderate supplies of straw. 
 
For  Wisconsin, hay prices were $3.95 low er at a quality-tested hay auction in Lancaster .      
 
Straw pric es in the Midwest  averaged $3.27 per s mall square bale (range of $ 1.50 to $5.00); $ 41.25 per 
large square bale (range of $22.50  to $60.00); and $43.19 per large round bale (range of $28.75  to 
$55.00).  Compared to the previous week, straw pric es for small square bales were 4% higher .  For large 
sq uare bales, prices were 3 % lower.  For large round bales, prices were 7 % higher.
